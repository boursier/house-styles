# Audiosocket (Ruby)

This covers all Ruby code, no matter what framework or purpose. Tests,
migrations, and Rake tasks are code too.

Guidelines aren't laws. What's important is **overall consistency**.
Anybody's welcome to change these, just get consensus and make sure
**all the existing code** matches your new guideline.

## The Laws

Yup, guidelines aren't laws. These are, though:

* Follow these. If you see code that doesn't, fix it.
* Use your brain. Ignore the guidelines when it's appropriate.
* ...but not unilaterally.
