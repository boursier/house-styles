# Audiosocket (Ruby)

This covers all Ruby code, no matter what framework or purpose. Tests,
migrations, and Rake tasks are code too. Guidelines aren't laws.
What's important is **consistency**. Anybody's welcome to change
these, just get consensus and make sure **all the existing code**
matches your new guideline.
